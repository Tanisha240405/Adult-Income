# Adult Income Classification

This project explores the **Adult Income Dataset (Census Income Dataset)** to predict whether a person earns over $50K a year using demographic data and machine learning models.

## 📊 Overview

The Adult Income dataset is a classic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information such as age, education, occupation, and more. The goal is to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr based on these attributes.

This project includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training using different algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- **Attributes**:
  - Age, Workclass, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, etc.
  - Target: Income (>50K or <=50K)
